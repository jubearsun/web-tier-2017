# Client Work

## What to Expect
If you've never done client work before, you'll find that most clients
have no experience with web design or development and therefore will need you
to guide them.  Depending on what the client wants, deadlines can change a lot
from their initial expectations.

When I meet with a client, if it's someone I don't know, I usually make them
sign some sort of contract specifying expectations (a lot of clients are really
unresponsive, therefore pushing back our deadlines, or don't give me the information
that I need to continue working on the website), and go over what they want
in a website and examples of other similar websites they like.

For InnoD client work, I tend to try and take on static website projects because 
content management stuff is more complicated and most clubs don't really need it.
Additionally, content management systems can break in the future and the future
web tier leaders will be bombarded with emails from the club saying their website
broke and we have to fix it (this is also why I make them sign the contract).

Some clients don't really know what they want, they just want the website to look
good, which is why I make them link similar websites so we can have a point of 
reference.  I also take time to learn about what their club is and what they do
and go through their current website (if they have one) and ask them questions
about each section.

Some clients really want a lot of things and you have to really work with them
to figure out what is feasible and what isn't (I had a client who wanted a whole
database for their members so you can look them up on the website).  I usually just
try to make everything as easy as possible so we can meet the deadline.
