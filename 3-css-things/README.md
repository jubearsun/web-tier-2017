# Cool Things You Can Do With CSS

I think all too often people focus on making cool animations and effects with javascript and don't
really take the time to fully understand CSS.  In reality a lot of animations don't need CSS
as long as you understand CSS really well!

Just search "css animations" on codepen and look at all the cool things you can do.

Pseudoelements are used to style specific parts of an element.  They are very useful if you want
to save space in your HTML files.  

Examples of things you can do: hamburger, hover effects, [real life innod example](https://xd.adobe.com/view/436c3c87-1d58-46d8-9bf3-692f9beb8f46/screen/7474b64f-9f7e-4306-ba1c-f3d177b090d8/Web-1920-2/)

I will be showing you guys the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements today, along with 
`nth-child`.  Then you guys will get a chance to partner up and make something cool using
pseudo-elements!
